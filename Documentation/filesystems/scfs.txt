What is SCFS
============

1. Overview
SCFS is Samsung Compression File System for Samsung Android devices. Similar to 
the eCryptFS filesystem, it is stacked on top of a native ("Lower") filesystem 
to provide the additional per-cluster compression feature. Cluster size and 
compression algorithm can be changed optionally during format/mount time.

SCFS was developed exclusively for usage on the read-only /system partition.
Mounting on other devices or partitions is NOT recommended.

SCFS works only with properly "formatted" partitions, either with the make_scfs
tool, or proper SCFS writes (i.e. via cp command from an existing EXT4 partition).

2. Supported features:

 - regular file reads
 - regular file append writes
 - transparent compression/decompression
 - variable cluster size (16KB default)
 - various compression algorithms (LZO default)

3. Unsupported features:

 - non-append writes
 - mmap for writes
 - bmap
 - debugfs-style tool support

4. Notes:

 - Some or all of the clusters in a given file may remain uncompressed.
 - In some cases, files may actually increase in size after compression,
   because of SCFS metadata and/or byte alignment padding appended:
    - A file with none of the clusters were compressed
    - A file, compressed with saved space less than that of alignment + metadata


Usage Guide
===========

1. Mounting SCFS

  mount -t scfs -o [ro|rw] <src_dir> <dst_dir>

    ro,rw (default)     same as ext4		

    <lower_dir>         mountpoint for the compressed system partition
                        (/.system)

    <upper_dir>         SCFS mountpoint, system partition
                        (/system)

2.  Unmounting SCFS

  *** IMPORTANT ***
  The <upper_dir> MUST BE unmounted BEFORE the <lower_dir> is unmounted:

    umount /system
    umount /.system

2. Error handling <TBD>

3. Miscellaneaous interface

  3.1. statfs

  If f_type of struct statfs is 0x53305955 (SCFS_MAGIC), it is indicative of
  the filesystem for a given path being SCFS.

  3.2. Kernel support for SCFS

  If /proc/filesystems list includes scfs, and sysfs node /sys/fs/scfs/system_type
  exists, then SCFS is enabled in the kernel.

  3.3. System partition compressed flag

  Even if sysfs node /sys/fs/scfs/system_type exists, if it is read to be "ext4"
  instead  of "scfs", the system partition is not formatted in SCFS.
